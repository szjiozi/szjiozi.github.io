Hi! I am currently a second-year masterâ€™s student at New York University(NYU) majoring in Computer Engineering. I am working with Prof. [Ashish Sabharwal](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~sabhar/) and Prof. [Niranjan Balasubramanian](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~niranjan/index.html). Before that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK) advised by Prof. [Benyou Wang](https://wabyking.github.io/old.html).

Currently, my research interest lies in building intelligent and efficient LLM system with powerful reasoning abilities, capable of collaborating with human and interacting with external environment to complete complex tasks. I will graduate in May 2026 and I am looking for Ph.D. opportunity starting from fall 2026.

Outside of research, I loves playing basketball and watching basketball matches (Stephen Curry! What an incredible player!).
